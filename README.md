# manga_creator

A collection of small scripts to help manage a manga library (target: Kobo).

This repository currently contains a `packer` utility that groups chapter
archives into volume directories.

Overview
- Language: Python (standard library only for now)
- Target platform: Linux (tested on Linux Mint 22.3 / Debian 13)

All package are managed with `uv` (TODO: add link & few example)

## TODO

- [ ] finish packer
- [ ] comic info edit
- [ ] epub builder (kindle comic convertor <3)
- [ ] calibre sync !?
