# Notes:
# - This workflow runs on pushes and pulls to main/master.
# - `mypy` is run with defaults and currently allowed to fail the job; remove the `|| true` to make it strict.
# - `reviewdog` integration is provided as a commented example; enable and configure it if you want PR annotations from linters.
# - Consider adding a separate job or matrix to test across multiple Python versions if you intend to support them.
